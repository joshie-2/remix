# Testing out a neat new framework called REMIX!

A co-worker clued me in to this really neat framework from the creators of React Router.

I found the concept of bringing everything back to server side rendering and nested routing super interesting.

## Partially Completed

There is still quite a bit of this project left to complete however I am really enjoying the "Jokes App" tutorial!

If you are interested in giving Remix a GO! Check out the tutorial here ðŸ‘‡
